# CSS calc() Function Calculation Error

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while using the `calc()` function in CSS to dynamically calculate element widths based on viewport width. The expected behavior is that the width of the element should be 50% of the viewport width, but the actual width is incorrect.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS code.  The `bugSolution.css` demonstrates the corrected code and explanation.

This issue highlights the importance of understanding unit consistency and operator precedence when using the `calc()` function in CSS.  Incorrect usage can lead to unpredictable and unexpected layout issues.
